					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Shipping Policy</h3>
					<!--<p>All orders will ship within 3-5 business days from the date of payment. All packages will be sent via USPS. When shipping overseas, customs can delay packages by up to 6 weeks. This doesn't happen often, but it can happen.</p>
					<p>All orders are sent via standard mail, unless noted otherwise. Notify the seller prior to making the purchase, if priority or first class mail is preferred.</p>-->
					<p>Each order you make may include a charge for delivery. If your delivery is subject to a delivery charge, it will be shown to you as a separate charge on the delivery confirmation page before you confirm your order. Any delivery charge added to your order will be dependant upon, amongst other things, the value of your order, the date and time of your delivery and your delivery address and charges may vary from week to week.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<div class="row" id='tax'>
					<!--<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Tax Policy</h3>
					<p>Items are subject to sales tax in the state to which the order is shipped. In accordance with state tax laws, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item-level discounts, gift-wrap charges, and an allocation of order-level shipping and handling charges and order-level discounts.<p>
					<p>The amount of tax charged on your order will depend upon many factors including Identity of the seller, type of item purchased, and destination of the shipment. Factors can change between the time you place an order and the time of credit card charge authorization, which could affect the calculation of sales taxes. The amount appearing on your order as Estimated Tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.</p>-->
					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Payment & Tax Policy</h3>
					<p>Payment may be made by debit or credit card. On occasion we may issue vouchers or "money off" coupons which will be accepted towards payment of an order. You cannot pay for your order by cash or cheque. The debit, credit and charge cards accepted by us are those listed on the web site on the date on which your order is placed.</p>
                    
                    <p>Authority for payment will be requested from your card issuer at the time of your order. We 'debit' your card with the full price of your order after we have delivered your shopping to you. We reserve the right to terminate our agreement with you if we are refused authority for payment or reasonably believe that payment will be refused at any stage.</p>
                    
                    <p>You agree to compensate us in full against all reasonable costs expenses and outgoings incurred by us in obtaining payments from you in the event a failed payment occurs. This will include an administration charge of not less than $20. We may at any time after a failed payment has occurred ask a debt collection agency to collect payment from you. </p>
                    <p>Where applicable, prices include Value Added Tax.</p>
