					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Shipping Policy</h3>
					<p>All orders will ship within 3-5 business days from the date of payment. All packages will be sent via USPS. When shipping overseas, customs can delay packages by up to 6 weeks. This doesn't happen often, but it can happen.</p>
					<p>All orders are sent via standard mail, unless noted otherwise. Notify the seller prior to making the purchase, if priority or first class mail is preferred.</p>

				<div class="row" id='tax'>
					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Tax Policy</h3>
					<p>Items are subject to sales tax in the state to which the order is shipped. In accordance with state tax laws, the total selling price of an item will generally include item-level shipping and handling charges, item-level discounts, gift-wrap charges, and an allocation of order-level shipping and handling charges and order-level discounts.<p>
					<p>The amount of tax charged on your order will depend upon many factors including Identity of the seller, type of item purchased, and destination of the shipment. Factors can change between the time you place an order and the time of credit card charge authorization, which could affect the calculation of sales taxes. The amount appearing on your order as Estimated Tax may differ from the sales taxes ultimately charged.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<div class="row" id='return'>
					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Return Policy</h3>
					<p>If you decide you don't want any item in your order you can return it to us within 14 days in the condition in which it arrived and we will issue you a full refund for the item. (Please note that you will be responsible for the cost of returning the item if it is not faulty). This does not affect your statutory rights.</p>

				<div class="row" id='privacy'>
					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Privacy Policy</h3>
					<p>We respect your privacy. The personal information that you give us is held with care and security. We do not sell, rent or transfer this information to third parties for their marketing purposes unless you agree otherwise. Our full privacy policy.</p>
					<p>At the time of your registration you will set a password. Please keep this secret, as you are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the confidentiality of your password. You are entirely responsible for all orders placed with us or information given to us under your e-mail address in combination with your password. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your e-mail address and/or password or any breach of security known to you.</p>

				<div class="row" id='security'>
					<h3 class="green-text text-darken-3">Security</h3>
					<p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.</p>
					<p>Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.</p>
					<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>
					<p>If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 394-079-1283 or via justnature.com.</p>
